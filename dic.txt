such thing and
the thinking has
is hosting a
significantly more congenial
theory the no
the no landau
longstanding open conjecture
such a proof
be a very
a longstanding open
more congenial with
open conjecture in
swampland something only
major new result
going on at
not even wrong
a proof would
particle physics at
conjecture in number
very major new
not competent to
the term physical
don answer a
recently sent me
zeros conjecture such
references major problem
equally well be
conjecture such a
play on the
significance is not
major problem for
sheer scale and
problem for anyone
anyone taking up
taking up an
up an interest
an interest in
in this field
says and what
this field has
been the sheer
certain specific topics
search advice from
advice from those
specific topics that
number theory the
for anyone taking
interest in this
giving separate references
and what its
is not competent
what the conjecture
did some detailed
sent me back
to do much
physics papers because
much more than
refer you to
than refer you
what its significance
to the term
competent to do
do much more
conjecture says and
that the survey
more than refer
actors some kind
its significance is
in number theory
was a little
writing not even
was writing not
that anonymity is
you start allowing
needed for the
of bad actors
for the whole
the whole thing
whole thing to
thing to work
to work but
work but once
known mathematician back
starting with the
for those mathematicians
summary for those
he announced a
do this more
an explanation of
anonymity is needed
live a peculiar
and feel that
to test quantum
are not wasting
in summary for
bad actors some
the in summary
enough time on
moderation is going
on mostly dumb
have been going
a student just
student just finishing
just finishing his
wasting enough time
time on mostly
rumor mill available
you to the
this more recently
explains various dualities
research but the
but the sorts
interest would be
particle physics jobs
sorts of directions
between math and
physics with those
with those doing
those doing this
doing this kind
is going on
kind of research
connections between math
some analysis of
and physics with
well be simply
geometric representation theory
but haven tried
mill available also
to a point
could equally well
did some analysis
is that anonymity
on at the
announced a proof
of research but
from the theoretical
physics jobs rumor
stuff you might
proof would be
jobs rumor mill
that significantly more
of moderation is
also of interest
would be any
from those like
the theoretical particle
haven tried to
kind of moderation
available also of
when was writing
of interest would
of what the
theoretical particle physics
usage by moore
by moore et
proof of another
of another very
and physics which
decades these topics
in the fact
mostly have roots
scale and complexity
have roots in
roots in seminal
in seminal ideas
seminal ideas of
and his collaborators
his collaborators and
be any up
survey reference section
have been worked
back when was
helpful in providing
tried to do
topics mostly have
work and this
and this survey
this survey should
survey should be
should be helpful
collaborators and involve
these topics mostly
be helpful in
mathematics is a
providing an overview
overview while some
deep connections between
of these papers
these papers could
papers could equally
in providing an
striking aspect of
the survey reference
little known mathematician
calculational methods developed
currently being done
back in when
of deep connections
they don answer
existence of deep
of the answer
little work is
take seriously also
being done presumably
because nobody has
four decades these
done presumably because
of this field
that these are
of the relation
these are not
is currently being
not physics papers
physics part of
of the survey
papers because they
the sheer scale
this work and
section contains pages
are not physics
is that these
while some of
which relatively little
characterized as mathematics
testable hopefully science
about physics striking
an overview while
the survey is
reference section contains
survey is that
a question about
the answer is
answer a question
physics striking aspect
because they don
reflected in the
the computer program
a for an
theorists in the
all this work
and complexity of
question about physics
what makes a
last four decades
intensively during the
very major result
physics which heavily
conjecture before that
for an explanation
result on the
the twin prime
twin prime conjecture
prime conjecture before
emphasizes certain specific
governs fundamental physics
explanation of what
of view on
a point of
heavily emphasizes certain
describe exactly what
its usage by
to describe exactly
hard to describe
major result on
moore et al
et al it
al it refers
work is currently
which heavily emphasizes
before that he
refers to a
on the twin
physical mathematics is
view on the
relation of math
landscape swampland something
separate references major
it refers to
activity she points
is reflected in
its own and
but it unclear
basis after starting
theory research the
in when he
developed in quantum
another very major
pages giving separate
at the new
research is reflected
it unclear who
as mathematics it
with the in
unclear who is
is a play
is doing it
it or on
or on what
term physical mathematics
simply characterized as
and string theory
string theory research
contains pages giving
doing it or
complexity of all
and physics in
who is doing
in quantum field
quantum field theory
the last four
on what basis
me back when
field theory and
research the huge
in its usage
after starting with
the huge volume
volume of this
of this research
this research is
on the relation
mathematics it hard
what basis after
mathematician back in
about though is
with attending math
lost new input
this story they
so conceived the
on intensively during
theory and string
test quantum gravity
worked on intensively
a good job
she points to
to has been
quietly agreed with
string theory an
an the bad
the bad theory
bad theory activity
theory activity she
the mid guts
with her that
new particles in
on wednesday is
have been of
much more worth
been worked on
started in the
of theoretical activity
theoretical activity which
activity which has
which has problems
her about though
has problems much
to extend the
huge volume of
worth discussing what
what most disagree
proving theorems instead
disagree with her
with her about
more worth discussing
agreed with her
out to us
mathematics recently he
bad arguments for
that particle physics
points to has
center of theoretical
more on the
range opened up
were started in
most disagree with
for decades but
this see the
with the talks
the talks mentioned
talks mentioned and
mentioned and with
do a good
and with attending
attending math talks
math talks in
a huge success
for more on
on the current
been a huge
about the computer
significance for more
small group of
to discuss more
discuss more here
so little time
this week with
been of much
little time to
much significance for
discussing what most
had a for
of stragglers not
opened up by
those have been
debate about this
about this see
instead of spending
theory an the
years it seems
on for decades
more here or
of attempts to
current debate about
problems much more
not the center
which were started
of which were
model all of
writing about the
computer program question
tonight one theme
program question at
question at his
the speakers at
speakers at the
at the symposium
the symposium will
symposium will be
but don think
think those have
of much significance
far is why
so far is
one theme of
common response so
talk there on
post slides after
slides after the
after the talk
the talk tonight
huge success so
talk tonight one
recent examples heading
theorists have quietly
theme of which
dead in attacking
be the failure
the failure of
failure of a
of a series
response so far
will be fields
way to test
blown huge holes
being done at
theorems instead of
popular most influential
field and the
conventional name of
name of mathematical
physics in its
more conventional name
of mathematical physics
done at the
three very recent
shooting down a
to describe work
physics is dead
describe work being
work being done
a very major
success so far
going on for
been going on
have quietly agreed
seems to me
they proving theorems
intersection of math
decades but in
energy range opened
particle physics is
influential theorists have
of which will
been writing about
it seems to
physics to describe
at the intersection
be a lot
lot less popular
to me to
less popular most
but in recent
so far with
me to be
to subscribe to
far with the
mathematical physics to
a discussion so
world heavily promoted
its properties in
theory to make
of value in
extend the standard
of hep experiment
hep experiment and
yes one can
the world heavily
job moderating a
making these arguably
these arguably the
arguably the dominant
the dominant paradigm
dominant paradigm in
heavily promoted dubious
so behave some
recent years it
of the enter
be in england
huge holes in
the enter your
discover the most
standard model all
in this story
moderating a discussion
address to subscribe
discussion so behave
influential theorists in
have blown huge
england later in
a lot less
not the problem
the month in
good job moderating
that week is
break down the
or do a
week is the
her that particle
the problem they
finally find a
stragglers not the
movies and series
players in the
in the awards
down the best
we think will
best movies and
born on august
a jump on
on awards season
the best movies
season get ahead
is the week
ahead with a
with a look
get a jump
at the movies
on august in
november in theaters
to theaters and
streaming discover the
streaming want to
in japan he
get ahead with
paradigm in the
up by the
think will be
the awards race
the movies we
jump on awards
august in japan
claims that it
and series to
will be players
awards season get
series to watch
in november in
in theaters and
the current debate
subscribe to this
in the month
and streaming want
doing exactly what
arguments for building
watch in november
to watch in
a talk there
we break down
the most anticipated
coming to theaters
and streaming discover
which will be
the hype campaign
in some sense
old claims that
find people who
building a new
have used bad
used bad theory
don think those
for building a
with the old
the old claims
been the careful
to study its
investigation of the
offs coming to
spin offs coming
can find people
sequels and spin
going effort to
effort to study
be players in
bad theory to
make bad arguments
study its properties
properties in detail
new machine but
the new energy
in detail is
on going effort
is important another
one can find
the field has
this update the
mathematical discipline travels
some sense by
update the hype
a new machine
detail is important
new energy range
about looking for
is her treatment
of spending their
the careful investigation
week with the
another huge advance
busy this week
hype campaign marches
their time talking
be busy this
the on going
time talking about
of badly motivated
campaign marches on
of bad theory
evidence of badly
movies we think
treatment of hep
and spin offs
theories of new
spending their time
in england later
marches on just
just three very
very recent examples
her treatment of
machine but don
has been going
sense by doing
lot of bad
complains about looking
looking for evidence
on just three
important another huge
careful investigation of
bad theory pre
by doing exactly
aleph teaches itself
of men with
is a grave
motivated theories of
about this update
for evidence of
new input from
give a talk
examples heading to
empirical connections or
of new particles
a mathematical discipline
anything else and
and in particular
travels far from
in particular to
beset with very
particular to an
feel that they
quantum gravity update
time to discuss
a grave danger
connections or if
badly motivated theories
discipline travels far
down a lot
holes in that
in that bandwagon
else and in
still have closer
have closer empirical
the conjecture says
an empirical science
if the discipline
has been writing
its empirical source
the discipline is

me about mathematics is that of
more congenial with a more promising
the field manages to stay healthy

the first years the thinking has
at the question that has always
that has always fascinated me about

break down the best movies and
and streaming want to get a
with a look at the movies
england later in the month in
awards season get ahead with a
and spin offs coming to theaters
high school and college mathematics and
most disagree with her about though
though is her treatment of hep
bad model building in particle physics
huge advance for the field and
disagree with her about though is
for the field and the on
with the talks mentioned and with
new particles in this story they
week with the talks mentioned and
moderating a discussion so behave some
movies and series to watch in
particle physics think she going after
complains about looking for evidence of
talks mentioned and with attending math
motivated theories of new particles in
the talks mentioned and with attending
in november in theaters and streaming
mentioned and with attending math talks
of badly motivated theories of new
to get a jump on awards
a good job moderating a discussion
be busy this week with the
on going effort to study its
about looking for evidence of badly
they proving theorems instead of spending
bandwagon in some sense by doing
badly motivated theories of new particles
busy this week with the talks
that bandwagon in some sense by
much of the week of the
worth discussing what most disagree with
so little time to discuss more
the week of the enter your
that week is the week of
in england later in the month
week is the week of the
going effort to study its properties
for evidence of badly motivated theories
be in england later in the
from its empirical source or still
that it was going to see
think she going after a small
extend the standard model all of
spending their time talking about this
more worth discussing what most disagree
in some sense by doing exactly

the conference is michael harris who
tried asking some of my colleagues
of the conference is michael harris
written extensively about mathematical research and
organizers of the conference is michael
harris who has written extensively about
writing about the computer program question
shooting down a lot of bad
bad theory activity she points to
my colleagues what they think of

success so far with the old
it was going to see extra
small group of stragglers not the
a huge advance for the field
bad theory to make bad arguments
activity which has problems much more
the center of theoretical activity which
theoretical activity which has problems much
so far with the old claims
huge success so far with the
proving theorems instead of spending their

group of stragglers not the center
to make bad arguments for building
which has problems much more worth
after a small group of stragglers
used bad theory to make bad
physics think she going after a
what most disagree with her about
not the center of theoretical activity
the old claims that it was
on for decades but in recent
theory to make bad arguments for
popular most influential theorists have quietly
has problems much more worth discussing
going after a small group of
she going after a small group
have used bad theory to make
who have used bad theory to
far with the old claims that
people who have used bad theory
find people who have used bad
a small group of stragglers not
her treatment of hep experiment and
directions find promising are very different
problems much more worth discussing what
much more worth discussing what most
of all this activity most common
about though is her treatment of
but in recent years it seems
that aleph teaches itself high school
theorems instead of spending their time
an the bad theory activity she
yes one can find people who
stragglers not the center of theoretical
to take an interest each year
theory an the bad theory activity
aleph teaches itself high school and
starting point is to imagine that
our starting point is to imagine
it seems to me to be
itself high school and college mathematics
in attacking bad model building in
this activity most common response so
for decades but in recent years
in recent years it seems to
decades but in recent years it
model building in particle physics think
point is to imagine that aleph
been going on for decades but
has been going on for decades
points to has been going on
been the careful investigation of the
seems to me to be a
have quietly agreed with her that
of theoretical activity which has problems
in particle physics think she going
can find people who have used
the bad theory activity she points
of value in mathematics recently he
string theory an the bad theory
be a very major new result
which were started in the mid
she points to has been going
mathematicians to take an interest each
of which were started in the
years it seems to me to
is dead in attacking bad model
imagine that aleph teaches itself high
physics is dead in attacking bad
particle physics is dead in attacking
her that particle physics is dead
trolls and other sorts of bad
agreed with her that particle physics
quietly agreed with her that particle

some kind of moderation is going
for the whole thing to work
work but once you start allowing

tried to do this more recently
of moderation is going on at
marsh developed a much better test
you start allowing people to post

stuff you might want to take
the way forward is to abandon
agreement that results from mediation to
allowing people to post things anonymously
is needed for the whole thing
